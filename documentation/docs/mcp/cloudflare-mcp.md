This tutorial covers how to add [Cloudflare's MCP Servers](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) as Goose extensions to manage your Cloudflare infrastructure, debug applications, analyze traffic, and more using natural language.

Cloudflare provides multiple specialized MCP servers for different aspects of their platform, allowing you to interact with Workers, DNS, security features, analytics, and development tools.

## Example Usage

### Debugging Application Issues

Let's use the Observability server to debug performance issues with a Workers application:

:::info LLM
Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used for this task.
:::

#### Goose Prompt
```
I'm seeing high error rates on my Workers application "my-api-worker". Can you help me:
1. Check the recent error logs
2. Identify the most common error types
3. Analyze the performance metrics
4. Suggest optimizations based on the data
```

#### Expected Goose Output
```
I'll help you debug the issues with your "my-api-worker" application. Let me gather the observability data to identify the problems.

First, let me check the recent error logs for your worker:

[Goose uses the observability MCP server to fetch error logs]

I found several issues with your worker:

**Error Analysis:**
- 45% of errors are 500 Internal Server Errors
- 30% are timeout errors (exceeded 30s CPU limit)
- 25% are memory limit exceeded errors

**Performance Metrics:**
- Average response time: 2.3s (up 150% from last week)
- CPU usage: 85% average (critical threshold)
- Memory usage: 92% average (near limit)

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Database connection pooling issues causing timeouts
2. Memory leaks in JSON parsing for large payloads
3. Inefficient regex operations in request validation

**Recommended Optimizations:**
1. Implement connection pooling with proper cleanup
2. Stream large JSON payloads instead of loading into memory
3. Replace regex with more efficient string operations
4. Add caching for frequently accessed data

Would you like me to help implement any of these fixes?
```

### Managing Workers Bindings

Using the Workers Bindings server to set up storage and AI capabilities:

#### Goose Prompt
```
I need to set up a new Workers project with:
1. KV storage for caching
2. R2 bucket for file uploads
3. AI binding for text analysis
4. Durable Object for real-time features

Can you help me configure these bindings?
```

### Analyzing Traffic with Radar

Using the Radar server for security and traffic analysis:

#### Goose Prompt
```
Can you help me analyze the security posture of my domain example.com? I want to:
1. Check for any security threats or malicious traffic
2. Analyze global traffic patterns
3. Scan for vulnerabilities
4. Get recommendations for improving security
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Application Debugging
- **Observability Server**: Monitor errors, performance, and user experience
- **Logpush Server**: Analyze log patterns and data pipeline health
- **DNS Analytics**: Debug DNS resolution issues

### 2. Development & Deployment
- **Workers Bindings**: Configure storage, AI, and compute resources
- **Workers Builds**: Monitor deployment status and build health
- **Container Server**: Set up isolated development environments

### 3. Security & Compliance
- **Audit Logs**: Track configuration changes and access patterns
- **Cloudflare One CASB**: Monitor SaaS application security
- **Radar Server**: Threat intelligence and URL scanning

### 4. Analytics & Insights

- **AutoRAG**: Document management and retrieval
- **Documentation Server**: API reference and troubleshooting

## Best Practices

### Security
- Use scoped API tokens with minimal required permissions
- Regularly rotate API tokens
- Monitor API usage through audit logs
- Set up alerts for unusual activity

### Performance
- Use appropriate timeout values for different operations
- Cache frequently accessed data when possible
- Monitor rate limits and usage quotas
- Implement proper error handling and retries

### Development Workflow
- Start with the Documentation server for API reference
- Use Container server for isolated testing
- Monitor with Observability server during development
- Analyze with Radar server before going live

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors:**
- Verify API token has correct permissions
- Check token hasn't expired
- Ensure token is properly set in environment variables

**Rate Limiting:**
- Monitor API usage in Cloudflare dashboard
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Consider upgrading plan for higher limits

**Connection Issues:**
- Verify network connectivity to Cloudflare APIs
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure proper DNS resolution
